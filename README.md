# Asteroids ðŸš€

## Project Overview

Asteroids is a space-themed game where players control a spaceship to dodge or shoot falling asteroids. The goal is to survive as long as possible while earning points by destroying asteroids. Power-ups periodically appear, boosting the spaceshipâ€™s firing speed.

## Features

- Move the spaceship left and right with arrow keys.
- Shoot lasers to destroy asteroids and earn points.
- Avoid collisions with asteroids or face game over.
- Power-ups increase laser firing speed every 150 points.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: for the UI and game logic.
- **CSS**: for animations and styling.
- **HTML5**: for the basic structure.

## How to Play

- Use the **left** and **right** arrow keys to move the spaceship.
- **Destroy asteroids** to gain points, but avoid collisions.
- Absorb **power-ups** to increase firing speed.
- The game ends if you collide with an asteroid.

## Development Intent

This game was developed as a self-teaching project to improve my knowledge of React, particularly in state management, handling side effects (`useEffect`), and setting up intervals for gameplay loops.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** version 14+ is required.
