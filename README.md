# SUMMARY
This app is a space-themed asteroid game.
The game involves moving a spaceship left and right with the arrow keys. Asteroids fall from the top of the screen to the bottom. The ship may destroy the asteroids
with its laser to earn points, or dodge the asteroids. If the ship collides with an asteroid, the game is over. Once the score reaches a multiple of the powerup interval
(defaulted to 150), a powerball will fall from the top of the screen, allowing the ship to absorb it and increase its firing speed.

# APP INTENT

management.
